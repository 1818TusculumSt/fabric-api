# Fabric MCP Prompting Strategies

## How Fabric Patterns Work

Fabric patterns are **expert-crafted system prompts** that you can apply to any content. When you use this MCP server, Claude receives:

1. **The Pattern Prompt** - Expert instructions for the task
2. **Your Input** - The content you want analyzed
3. **Claude's Intelligence** - To execute the pattern

**No external APIs needed!** The MCP server just delivers the prompts to Claude.

## Core Prompting Strategies

### 1. Pattern as System Prompt

Each Fabric pattern is a carefully designed system prompt that:
- Defines the AI's identity and purpose
- Provides step-by-step instructions
- Specifies exact output format
- Includes quality guidelines

**Example Pattern Structure:**
```markdown
# IDENTITY and PURPOSE
You are an expert at extracting wisdom from content...

# STEPS
- Extract summary in 25 words
- Extract 20-50 surprising ideas
- Extract 10-20 insights
...

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- Only output Markdown
- Write IDEAS as exactly 16 words
- No warnings or notes
...
```

### 2. Chaining Patterns

You can chain multiple patterns for complex workflows:

**Example Workflow:**
1. `extract_article_wisdom` ‚Üí Get key insights
2. `summarize` ‚Üí Condense insights
3. `create_quiz` ‚Üí Generate quiz from summary

**How to do it:**
```
First, use extract_article_wisdom on this article: [paste]

[Review output]

Now use the summarize pattern on those insights

[Review output]

Finally, use create_quiz to make questions from the summary
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Patterns work best when you iterate:

```
Use improve_writing on this draft: [paste draft]

[Review suggestions]

Apply those changes, then run improve_writing again on the result
```

### 4. Pattern Combinations

Combine patterns for multi-faceted analysis:

```
Analyze this article with these Fabric patterns:
1. extract_wisdom - for key insights
2. analyze_claims - for argument quality
3. find_logical_fallacies - for reasoning errors
4. rate_content - for overall quality
```

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Pattern

**For Analysis:**
- `extract_wisdom` - General insights
- `extract_article_wisdom` - News/articles
- `analyze_claims` - Arguments
- `analyze_answers` - Q&A content

**For Creation:**
- `create_quiz` - Test questions
- `create_markmap` - Mind maps
- `create_visualization` - Visual concepts
- `improve_writing` - Better prose

**For Summarization:**
- `summarize` - General summaries
- `extract_wisdom` - Wisdom + summary
- `rate_content` - Quality assessment

**For Code:**
- `explain_code` - Plain language
- `improve_code` - Enhancements
- `create_coding_project` - Project ideas

### Pattern Input Guidelines

**‚úÖ Good Input:**
- Complete articles/transcripts
- Full context included
- Original formatting preserved
- Sufficient length (patterns work best with substantial content)

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Fragments without context
- Multiple unrelated pieces
- Overly short content (< 100 words)
- Mixed languages (unless pattern supports it)

### Understanding Output Constraints

Many patterns have **strict output formatting**:

```markdown
# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- Write IDEAS bullets as exactly 16 words
- Write INSIGHTS bullets as exactly 16 words
- Extract at least 25 IDEAS
- Do not give warnings or notes
```

**Why?** Consistent structure makes outputs:
- Easy to scan
- Comparable across runs
- Parseable by other tools
- Focused and concise

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Pattern Customization

You can modify patterns on-the-fly:

```
Use the extract_wisdom pattern but:
- Focus only on technical insights
- Extract 10 ideas instead of 25
- Add a "APPLICATIONS" section

Here's the content: [paste]
```

### 2. Multi-Document Analysis

Apply patterns across multiple sources:

```
Use analyze_claims on these three articles about AI:

Article 1: [paste]
Article 2: [paste]
Article 3: [paste]

Compare the claims across all three
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Application

Adapt patterns to your domain:

```
Use extract_wisdom but focus on:
- DevOps best practices
- Infrastructure patterns
- Automation opportunities

Content: [paste technical documentation]
```

### 4. Meta-Pattern Analysis

Analyze the patterns themselves:

```
Show me the get_fabric_pattern for extract_wisdom

[Review the pattern]
